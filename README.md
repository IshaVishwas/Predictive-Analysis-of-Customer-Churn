# Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn for a Subscription Service

## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning to identify customers at high risk of churning from subscription-based services, helping to understand customer behavior and identify key factors influencing churn. Itâ€™s applicable to industries such as telecom, streaming, and SaaS, providing a foundation for proactive customer retention strategies.

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   * Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), specifically focusing on customer subscription data to build predictive models.

2. **Data Import and Cleaning**  
   * Imported the dataset using Pandas, examined for missing values, and addressed outliers.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   * Conducted EDA with statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover trends and key variables affecting churn.

4. **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing**  
   * Performed encoding for categorical features, normalized numerical values, and applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

5. **Model Building**  
   * Developed multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and evaluated them based on accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Handling Imbalanced Data**  
   * Used techniques like SMOTE to address data imbalance in the churn target variable.

7. **Visualization of Model Results**  
   * Visualized key metrics using ROC curves, confusion matrices, and feature importance charts.

8. **Deployment**  
   * Designed a basic deployment setup using Flask/FastAPI to simulate real-time predictions.

## Key Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis, machine learning
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn**: Model training and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Flask or FastAPI**: Model deployment

## Results and Insights
The final model provides insights into which factors most impact customer churn, offering actionable strategies for improving retention. By identifying high-risk customers, companies can tailor interventions to reduce churn.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can drive effective customer retention strategies in subscription-based businesses. Future improvements could include more advanced deployment and additional features to enhance predictive power.
